# SystemLink ML Examples




## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks to demonstrate how to leverage National Instrument's SystemLink Server for developing and deploying machine learning solutions. These notebooks can be run in the JupyterHub Plugin which is provided by SystemLink Server

#### SystemLink JupyterHub Plugin

SystemLink Server provides JupyterHub as an optional plugin which can be used to create, edit, run and share Jupyter notebooks. In addition to the abilities of JupyterHub, this plugin also supports SystemLink Python APIs, which can be used to read, write and modify the data present in the SystemLink Server. 

## Notebooks

The notebooks will cover the following:
- Using SystemLink's Python APIs to query and load data from SystemLink Server.
- Data prepration and training an ML model to classify wavefroms.
- Deploying a trained model in SystemLink to classify wavefroms.

#### Dataset used: 
The notebooks uses the wafer dataset, which is a public dataset available here : http://www.timeseriesclassification.com/description.php?Dataset=Wafer

#### Model used: 
The notebooks uses a simple neural network model just for demonstration. It is not an optimized model for this dataset.
