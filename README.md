## SystemLink ML Examples

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks to demonstrate how to leverage National Instrument's SystemLink Server for developing and deploying machine learning solutions.

Dataset used : The notebooks uses the wafer dataset, which is a public dataset available here : http://www.timeseriesclassification.com/description.php?Dataset=Wafer

Model used : The notebooks uses a simple neural network model just for demonstration. It is not an optimized model for this dataset.
